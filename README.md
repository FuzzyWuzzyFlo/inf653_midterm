This project is a PHP OOP-based REST API for managing quotations â€” including both famous quotes and user submissions. The API follows REST principles and supports CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for quotes, authors, and categories. All responses are returned in JSON format with proper HTTP status codes and clear error messages.
